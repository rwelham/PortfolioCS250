How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Being able to interpret user needs includes looking at things like, what do they want the final product to do, why are they asking for the final product, how will it help the user, and what form should the product take. Creating "user stories" helps with this by getting more information about what a user wants and then making them into priority lists so it's easier to know what needs to be worked on first or what it most important to the user. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by trying to figure out the best wayt to break a program down into pieces. For example, if I'm coding a program that takes multiple files and classes, I try to break it down into what needs to be with each file. From there I'll work on one class, make sure that works, and then incorporate the next class in until I've put all the pieces together. Being able to do retrospectives is definitely another thing I'll be incorporating as being able to reflect on my work to improve it is very valuable. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means being able to support the rest of the team without falling behind on your own work. A good team member should be able to get their own work done, or know when to ask for help or clarification when needed, and be ready to offer support for other teammates as well.
